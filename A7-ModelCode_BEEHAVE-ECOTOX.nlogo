;THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL BEEHAVE OR BEEMAPP VERSION!
;The beginning and the end of all alterations to the official BEEHAVE version are marked with "_ADDITION TO THE OFFICIAL MODEL VERSION-START_" and "_ADDITION TO THE OFFICIAL MODEL VERSION-END_"

;___________________________________________________ADDITION TO THE OFFICIAL MODEL VERSION-START_________________________________________________________________________________

;This version was changed to: 1) include an ecotoxicological module and
;                             2) allow the model to also start a simulation run on a particular day that deviates from Julian day 1
;                             3) alter the starting conditions of the beehive to simulate specific experiments

# BEEHAVEecotox model

This model version was developed to mechanistically integrate exposure and ecotoxicological procedures into the BEEHAVE model (Becher et al. 2014), which can be parameterised with common ecotoxicological regulatory studies. The model is based on the BEEHAVE_BeeMapp2016 available at http://beehave-model.net/download/.

All the changes to the code are highlighted in the code itself and described in detail in the following manuscript and its supplementary material:
Preuss T.G., Agatz A., Goussen B., Roeben V., Rumkee J., Zakharova L., Thorbek P. ( ) The BEEHAVEecotox model - Integrating a mechanistic effect module into the honeybee colony model,
submitted to "Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry" journal.

In the code, new variables are marked with "ETOX_" in front of the variable name and new procedures are marked with "_ETOX" at the end of the procedure name. The beginning and the end of all alterations to the BEEHAVE_BeeMapp2016 are marked with "_ADDITION TO THE OFFICIAL MODEL VERSION-START_" and "_ADDITION TO THE OFFICIAL MODEL VERSION-END_".

In the supplementary material to the manuscript, all the alterations to the model and the rationales behind them are described in the format of the ODD protocol (Overview, Design concepts and Details) by Grimm et al. (2006, 2010, 2020).

Additionally, all the necessary calculations for the input parameters of the ecotoxicological module as well as input sheets for BehaviorSpace simulations are provided in the validation input excel sheet. Conducted sensitivity analysis and validation simulation settings are also saved as the "Experiments" in the BehaviorSpace of this model version.


# Terms of use of the software BEEHAVEecotox (2021)


BEEHAVEecotox (2021) is the implementation of an ecotoxicological module with the associated changes into the model BEEHAVE_BeeMapp2016, developed by Matthias Becher and colleagues (more information on this model is provided below).


This implementation is based on the software platform NetLogo (Wilensky 1999), and can be downloaded for free from https://github.com/ibacon-GmbH-Modelling/BEEHAVEecotox.

Please refer to the BEEHAVEecotox publication (Preuss T. G. et al.; see above) when using this version of the BEEHAVE model.

## Recommendations when using BEEHAVE:

• Please refer to the BEEHAVE publication (Becher et al. 2014; see above) and the BEEHAVE website (http://beehave-model.net/) when using BEEHAVE.

• We recommend that any publication or report based on using BEEHAVE shall include, in the Supplementary Material, the very NetLogo file that was used to produce the corresponding figure, table, or other kinds of results, as well as the "Experiments" in the BehaviorSpace and all necessary input files (see Supplementary Material of Becher et al. 2013 as example).

• You might want to modify the NetLogo code implementing BEEHAVE, for example by adding further outputs, or running specific scenarios. To check whether you are still using the original version of BEEHAVE click the "Version Test" button, which runs the model under specific settings and defined random numbers and informs the user if the code was changed. Note that not all changes to the code can be detected by this test. If you changed the code, we recommend to document these changes in all detail and to provide a revised ODD model description in which the modified or added elements are highlighted.
